# User Management System - Project Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Login Route (Issue #1)
- **Problem**: There were two identical login route definitions in user_routes.py, one with include_in_schema=False.
- **Solution**: Removed the duplicate login route definition to ensure there's only one endpoint handling login requests.
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/routers/user_routes.py`

### 2. Email Verification Token Security (Issue #2)
- **Problem**: Email verification tokens were stored in plain text in the database, creating a security vulnerability.
- **Solution**: Implemented token hashing using bcrypt for secure storage in the database. Created functions for generating, hashing, and verifying tokens.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/utils/security.py`
  - `app/services/user_service.py`
  - `app/services/email_service.py`
  - `app/models/user_model.py`
- **Tests Added**:
  - `tests/test_security.py`

### 3. Nickname Generation Improvements (Issue #3)
- **Problem**: The nickname generation function needed more testing and robustness.
- **Solution**: Enhanced the nickname generator to create more diverse and robust nicknames with configurable length constraints and validation.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/utils/nickname_gen.py`
- **Tests Added**:
  - `tests/test_nickname_gen.py`

### 4. Database Connection Error Handling (Issue #4)
- **Problem**: There was no proper error handling for database connection failures.
- **Solution**: Improved error handling by adding retry logic and proper error logging for database connection failures.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/database.py`
  - `app/main.py`
- **Tests Added**:
  - `tests/test_database.py`

### 5. URL Validation (Issue #5)
- **Problem**: There was no proper validation for profile URLs (LinkedIn, GitHub, profile pictures).
- **Solution**: Created validation functions for GitHub, LinkedIn, and profile picture URLs to ensure they are properly formatted and point to valid domains.
- **Files Created**:
  - `app/utils/url_validation.py`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/schemas/user_schemas.py`
- **Tests Added**:
  - `tests/test_url_validation.py`

### 6. Rate Limiting for Login Attempts (Issue #6)
- **Problem**: There was no rate limiting for login attempts across different sessions, making the system vulnerable to brute force attacks.
- **Solution**: Implemented a flexible rate limiter that can prevent brute force attacks by limiting login attempts based on IP address and username combinations.
- **Files Created**:
  - `app/utils/rate_limiter.py`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/services/user_service.py`
  - `app/routers/user_routes.py`
- **Tests Added**:
  - `tests/test_rate_limiter.py`
  - `tests/test_api/test_rate_limiting.py`

## Additional Fixes

### 1. Import Errors
- Fixed various import errors and missing dependencies in the codebase.
- Ensured consistent function naming across modules.

### 2. GitHub Workflow
- Updated the GitHub workflow file to use the correct Docker image tags.
- Added DockerHub secrets for successful deployment.

## Test Coverage

The following tests were added to improve test coverage:

1. **Security Tests**:
   - Tests for password hashing and verification
   - Tests for token generation, hashing, and verification

2. **Nickname Generation Tests**:
   - Tests for nickname format and validation
   - Tests for nickname uniqueness
   - Tests for length constraints
   - Tests for custom word lists

3. **Database Tests**:
   - Tests for database connection initialization
   - Tests for retry logic
   - Tests for connection error handling

4. **URL Validation Tests**:
   - Tests for GitHub URL validation
   - Tests for LinkedIn URL validation
   - Tests for profile picture URL validation
   - Tests for handling invalid URLs

5. **Rate Limiting Tests**:
   - Tests for rate limit enforcement
   - Tests for IP-specific rate limiting
   - Tests for rate limit expiration
   - Tests for resetting rate limits after successful login

## Security Improvements

1. **Token Security**:
   - Implemented bcrypt hashing for email verification tokens
   - Added secure token generation and verification

2. **Brute Force Protection**:
   - Added rate limiting for login attempts
   - Implemented IP-based rate limiting to prevent attacks across different sessions

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Added URL validation for profile links
   - Improved error handling for invalid inputs

## Deployment

The project is now successfully deploying to DockerHub with all automated tests passing on GitHub Actions. The Docker image is built and pushed to DockerHub with the following tag format:

```
ykarthik03/user_management:<github-sha>
```

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Implementation**: Consider implementing one of the features from the features.md file.
2. **Documentation**: Update the project documentation to reflect the new changes and improvements.
3. **Reflection Document**: Create a reflection document as required for the project submission.

## Conclusion

The User Management System has been significantly improved with enhanced security, better error handling, and more comprehensive test coverage. All identified issues have been fixed, and the project now meets the requirements for quality assurance, test coverage, and deployment.
