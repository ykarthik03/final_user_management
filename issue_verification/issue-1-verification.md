# Issue 1 Verification: Duplicate Login Route

## Issue Description
The issue reported a duplicate login route in the user_routes.py file, with one route potentially having `include_in_schema=False`.

## Verification Process
1. Examined the user_routes.py file thoroughly
2. Searched for all instances of login routes
3. Checked for any routes with `include_in_schema=False` parameter

## Findings
After thorough examination of the codebase, only one login route was found at line 205:

```python
@router.post("/login", response_model=TokenResponse)
async def login(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends(), db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db), request: Request = None):
```

No duplicate login routes were found in the file. This suggests that the issue has already been resolved in a previous update to the codebase.

## Conclusion
Issue 1 is verified as resolved. The codebase currently contains only one login route implementation, which follows best practices.
